# Hello!
Hi, my name is Stasiu!

I don't really do much here.
I use mostly Rust, Lua and Python but I have a bit of experience in C# (Unity and .Net) and HTML/CSS/JS

# My projects
Most of the projects I work on never get posted publicly but here are some of the ones that did:
* [Retro Gadgets community docs](https://github.com/NexTre-dev/retro-gadgets-docs/)
* [Retro Gadgets stuff](https://github.com/Tresquel/rgGadgets)
* [JSONCleaner](https://github.com/Tresquel/JSONCleaner)
* [Steam workshop mods](https://steamcommunity.com/id/itsamestachu/myworkshopfiles/) (mostly mods for Teardown and Retro Gadgets)


Here are my Github stats:
